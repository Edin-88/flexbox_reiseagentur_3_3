        We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of comfort and quality,
        and a solid value to our guests. These inns offer a superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming
        atmosphere, <br> traditional cuisine, and authentic charm. They are typically small,
        independently-owned properties which reflect the character and hospitality of the surrounding 
        alpine community. <br> We know the owners personally, have a longstanding relationship with them,
        and we find they bend over backwards to provide our guests with an exceptional experience.
